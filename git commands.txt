git clone https://github.com/griffinslt/newGitTest.git
git status #Â this says what is different between the repository on the machine and the internet
git add gitTest.py
git status
git commit -m "added gitTest.py" #the change was added but it must be committed to the repository
#this is not synced online yet
git push  #this syncs the machine and github.com
git pull #opposite to push
git add -A #adds all
These commands only work inside the repository


commit changes every small change

sync every few hours to make sure there are no major changes
if there a conflict, when you sync you manually manage the conflict

if make a mistake and are stuck use "esc:wq"
if you commit without a -m it is for a multi-line message "esc:wq"  is to exit
